## Understanding the UABC Captive Portal

```
    Domain   | PHP Script | HTML Reference |    Util    | url={ImportantId}
https://pcw.uabc.mx/{phpScript}?{htmlReference}&{util}=true&url=ComputerId
```

## How to Use

How does this application work?

1. Detects if you are connected to the UABC WiFi network.
2. Accesses the URL `https://pcw.uabc.mx/` (the captive portal that requires login to access the internet).
3. Captures the redirected URL and extracts your device's ID.
4. Intercepts an HTTP request and modifies the URL to include your credentials.
5. Sends the modified request to the captive portal.
6. The captive portal logs you in automatically.
7. Enjoy!
